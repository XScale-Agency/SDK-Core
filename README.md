# XScale Agency Package Starter Kit

This starter kit is an updated version of the Adonis.js [@adonisjs/package-starter-kit](https://github.com/adonisjs/pkg-starter-kit) designed to expedite the development process for XScale Agency projects. It provides a solid foundation with modern tooling to streamline your workflow.

- **ESLint V9:** Keeps your code clean and consistent with the latest Adonis.js best practices. Refer to the upgrade guide: https://adonisjs.com/blog/upgrading-eslint-typescript-setup
- **Changeset Versioning:** Manages project versions and changelogs efficiently using `changeset`.
- **Husky Git Hooks:** Enforces code quality checks and automates workflows with Husky: https://typicode.github.io/husky/
